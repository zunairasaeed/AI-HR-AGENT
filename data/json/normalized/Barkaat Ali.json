experience data & analytics engineer ascend analytics z december 2024 –present * lahore, hybrid • streamlined the modernization of data warehouse infrastructure (as/400) to azure cloud, shifting infrastructure from capex to opex and reduc- ing costs by 80%. • re-architected the enterprise data model (edm), transitioning from a complex fact constellation schema to a star schema, signiﬁcantly improv- ing query performance and simplifying analytics. • designed and implemented an audit logging system in azure sql to monitor and analyze activity, enhancing data governance and compli- ance. • consolidated 400+ datasets in azure data factory into 37 reusable, pa- rameterized datasets, streamlining the etl architecture and eliminating redundant data sources. • reduced the number of pipelines from 700 to 250 by developing dy- namic, metadata-driven pipelines, greatly improving maintainability and scalability. data engineer dotlabs z june 2024 –present * lahore, onsite project: hopi housing service • developed a scalable data pipeline to capture real-time changes for the hopi housing service, enabling eﬃcient data processing and insightful reporting. • transformed json streaming data to a structured format using kinesis firehose, storing the results in parquet, reducing query costs by 70%. • implemented a dynamodb trigger using a lambda function to capture changes and store them in s3, sending real-time updates to slack via sns. • built an interactive kpi dashboard in amazon quicksight to present data insights to stakeholders for better decision-making. • engineered complex data transformations using aws glue, optimizing the processing logic and storing results in parquet, reducing memory usage by 40%. • automated weekly crawlers in aws glue to handle evolving schemas, ensuring the data catalog remains agile and up-to-date with the latest data. • leveraged athena for querying the results in the data catalog and inte- grated with quicksight for advanced data visualizations and reporting. project: data warehousing for sunderstorm cannabis company • developed a scalable data pipeline for sunderstorm, using aws glue to process data from apis and store it in amazon s3, reducing manual eﬀort by 40%. • implemented scd type 2 to track historical changes, improving report- ing accuracy by 25%. • designed a redshift data warehouse, optimizing the data model for faster querying and reporting, improving query performance by 30%. skills python/c++/c# sql/nosql aws redshift aws glue aws lambda aws kinesis aws athena aws ec2 azure data factory azure synapse
